# Cypress Automation Framework

This is a project which I have done to learn Cypress testing framework. The goal of the project was to create Cypress automation framework to showcase what I have learned.Tests are written using Cypress version 13.6.2.There are both positive and negative test cases. Main browser used for running tests was Google Chrome version 120.Tests also work on Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers.Both Page Object Model and Cypress Commands were used for creating and organizing test structure.

You can install all of the dependencies using **npm install**. All of the scripts for running tests are in the **package.json** file.
